Unusually it is Pinterest that lets me know this film. Stylings of celebrities are somehow a part of my inspiration especially in terms of color combos, and I often check them out on Pinterest. The other day, I found cozy styles of a girl on Pinterest and instantly loved it.

She is _Emma Roberts_. I actually like many fields of the U.S. entertainment, but don't know much about people around movies, so at the moment I didn't have any idea about who she is. After some googling, I figured out who she is and what her career has been. Among her filmography, the film I got interested in the most was [**_We're The Millers_**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1723121/?ref_=nm_knf_i1) cause I've really loved the comedy film made in Hollywood so far. ( I strangely believe the grosser the package of japanese version is, the cooler the content is) As a result, the film became one of the most laughable comedy film in my life. So here, I would like to summarize what made the film great in comparison to the sense of Japanese comedy.

### The great marriage of humour with humanity

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think most great comedy movies mixed humour with humanity in a good way. In case of the film, family love is well described with a nice scenerio where characters first just had to pretend to be family to achieve big drug deals smoothly and later with funny events, they gradually found out how precious family's connection is. After watching the film, I had some realization that comedy at some respects can be a format where humanity is expressed better than drama movies because funny things can conversely emphasize something serious like salt makes watermelon sweeter. I feel when it comes to humanity, the film did nicely what comedy can do, so I liked it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is the ideas that many japanese comedy lacks. We japanese people tend to regard comedy just as things which make us laugh and ignore the secondary effect of it. Especially in mass media, the tendency is so striking that comedy in Japan always underestimate and become merely something consumable not art.

### Open-mindndness to dirty jokes  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 80% jokes in the film are dirty and sexual. Dirty jokes are simply enjoyable to me, but I'm also curious about why dirty jokes are super acceptable in the U.S. where political collectness and #metoo action are widely spread. Looking at each joke in the film carefully, there are something common between them. By using dirty jokes, they just gave us something quite unexpected which is the fundamentals of comedy. They don't distinguish dirty jokes from other kinds of jokes like racism or politics. No matter what kinds of jokes, people in western countries have a kind of room where they can enjoy themselves by experiencing the feelings of surprise. Even if some jokes are agressive or toxic, they can be accepted friendly as long as they are in range of **JOKES**.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of japanese comedy, we actually have extremely sophisicated skills of specific ranges of comedy, but we sometimes can't laugh about some kinds of jokes because the concept of comedy are less recognized and developed. By getting  stimulated by wonderful comedy films like this film,  I hope we will broaden our sense of humor in the near future.




### The passion for creating comedy movies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was impressed when I saw the interview where _Emma Roberts_ & _Will Poulter_ were asked about how they decided to book for the film. They said that they instantly decided when they just started reading the brief scripts because it was super haralious and worth acting. I assume the quality of scripts is always a big factor of their career decision but what I admired is their attitude toward comedy movies. Their perception of comedy film are almost the same as drama or action films. In addition to that, after watching this high-quality comedy, I believe all people around the U.S. movies including script writers, directors, investors and actors have the huge amount of energy to create the quality comedy and never compromise, which always makes me feel envy.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, in terms of entertainment, I don't know why but there are certainly hierarchies of genres. In my opinion we are likely to regard comedy as something inferior to drama or action, which all the more make it harder to create great comedy. Even most comedians in Japan try to direct drama or action movies instead of pure comedy JUST BECAUSE IT SEEMS COOLER. It literally sucks.

Finally I would like to end this review with a clip of [a haralious kiss scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=UFmC0z_GpoU&feature=emb_title).  
(I especially like the way David Clark eats snakes during the kiss practice.)
